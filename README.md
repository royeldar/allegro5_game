# Game

## Brief description

This is a simple game framework built using Allegro5.

## Building instructions

### Linux

Building for a Linux distribution is pretty easy; simply run

```sh
meson setup build src
meson compile -C build
```

However, there might be dependency issues when trying to run the binary on a different pc.

Therefore, one can build a Flatpak bundle; in order to do that, run

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/build.sh
```

This will create an application bundle called `game.flatpak`.

One may also build a Flatpak bundle containing debugging information, by running

```sh
./scripts/debug/build.sh
```

This will create a runtime bundle called `game.Debug.flatpak`.

### Windows

Building for Windows is done using MinGW, inside a Docker container:

```sh
./scripts/win32/setup.sh
./scripts/win32/build.sh
```

This creates a base Docker image called `game-base-win32`, and then a zip archive called `game.zip`.

## Installation instructions

### Linux

Install the Flatpak bundle `game.flatpak` by running

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

Afterwards, run the app:

```sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

Uninstallation can be done by running

```sh
./scripts/uninstall.sh
```

### Windows

Simply unzip the archive `game.zip` anywhere, then run `game.exe`.

## Debugging (only for Linux)

Install the Flatpak bundle `game.Debug.flatpak` by running

```sh
./scripts/debug/install.sh
```

Enter a shell environment inside the Flatpak runtime:

```sh
./scripts/debug/run.sh
```

Then, one may run stuff like `gdb game`, etc.

Uninstallation can be done by running

```sh
./scripts/debug/uninstall.sh
```
